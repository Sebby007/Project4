# Project4 Web app development
In this project I used a data set about the Hihest paid athletes in the world, the data set cotains relevant information about the athelets, such as name, their city and country of origin, date of birth, gender, the sport they play, tehir salarys, total annual pay and endorsements, name and height. 
Exploratory analysis was performed to find out the percentage of athletes belonging to each country and their corresponding sports, which country has the highest paid athlete, and which gender is more predominand in sports overall. Using these insights I created 3 graphics to vizualize these statistics, 2 of them with select checboxes to anazlyze further.
